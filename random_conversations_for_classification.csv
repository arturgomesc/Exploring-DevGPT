You will present the user with case briefs similar to classic Supreme Court cases Summaries that are 3 sentences.  The game flows as follows.  You present the cases one at a time, asking the user for their decision directly after.  after the user gives their decision, you give them the post decision info, and then follow up with the next case.  The cases should not be real, but should be based on real cases.  Then ask the user for a decision.  Then, in three sentences, print a comparison of the decision to the real Supreme Court one.  The game covers 5 cases, and at the end, write a short news briefing as if the player was a judge about to become a Supreme Court justice, and summarize my judgment style based on my history, and what my tenure will likely mean for America.  After each case, print “What is your decision”? And then wait for user input.  Start by introducing the game in 2 sentences, and asking the user for their name.  After they provide the name, say “All rise for the honorable Judge NAME” and the give the first case.  Do not mention the real case info until after the decision is made by the user.","ChatGPTChatGPTWelcome to ""Supreme Court Judge"", an immersive game where you step into the shoes of a Supreme Court Justice, ruling on pivotal cases similar to those that have shaped America's legal landscape. Each case will test your understanding of the Constitution, precedents, and the changing tides of societal norms.May I have your name, please?",

This error typically occurs when there is an issue with the indentation of the code, specifically with spaces or tabs not being used correctly.To fix this error, make sure that all lines of code within the same block have consistent indentation. In Python, indentation is crucial to define the scope of blocks of code, such as loops, functions, and conditional statements.Here's an example of properly indented code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Make sure the lines are aligned with the same level of indentation, usually using spaces (four spaces per indentation level is a common convention in Python).If the error persists or if you have a larger code snippet that you would like help with, please provide more context or the surrounding code so that I can assist you further.",

2,udayhello,"July 20, 2023",https://chat.openai.com/share/a3634550-9752-479e-937a-b3db80c88449,how to put python code in websit,"To put Python code on a website, you have several options depending on your requirements and the functionality you want to achieve. Here are some common ways to integrate Python code into a website:Server-Side Scripting:Use a Python web framework like Flask, Django, or FastAPI to build a web application. These frameworks allow you to define routes and views that can execute Python code and render dynamic web pages.When a user visits a specific URL, the Python code executes on the server, processes data, interacts with databases, and generates HTML content to send back to the user's browser.Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):Create a Python-based API using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI. The API can handle HTTP requests and provide JSON data in response.On the client-side (JavaScript or another programming language), you can use AJAX or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to your Python API and consume the data in your web pages.Jupyter Notebooks on the Web:Jupyter notebooks can be converted to HTML, and you can embed them on your website. This allows you to share interactive Python code and data analysis with your audience.Jupyter notebooks can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, nbviewer, or JupyterHub.Code Snippets and Code Highlighting:You can use tools like Highlight.js or Prism.js to highlight and display code snippets on your website. This is useful if you want to show code examples, tutorials, or documentation with syntax highlighting.Widgets and Dashboards:Use Python libraries like Dash, Bokeh, or Plotly to create interactive data visualizations or dashboards. These can be embedded in your website to provide dynamic and engaging content.Remember, when deploying Python code on the web, security is essential. Avoid exposing sensitive information, and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.The method you choose will depend on your specific needs and the complexity of the web application or functionality you want to implement. Flask is a lightweight and straightforward web framework for beginners, while Django is a more feature-rich framework suitable for complex web applications. If you're interested in data visualization and interactivity, libraries like Plotly and Dash can be great choices.",

Point 3 refers to hosting Jupyter Notebooks on the web and embedding them in your website. Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to combine live code, text, equations, and visualizations. They are commonly used for data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and scientific research.To put Python code from a Jupyter Notebook on your website, follow these steps:Create a Jupyter Notebook: Write your Python code, add explanations, and create visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.Convert the Jupyter Notebook to HTML: Use the ""File"" menu in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook to save the notebook as an HTML file. This will convert your notebook into a static HTML document.Host the HTML file: You need to host the generated HTML file on a web server or a hosting service.

Python is a server-side language, while HTML is a client-side language. They operate in different environments, and Python code cannot be executed directly within an HTML file in a web browser.However, you can integrate Python code with HTML on the server-side using various methods:Server-Side Scripting: Use a Python web framework like Flask, Django, or FastAPI to create a web application. You can define routes and views that execute Python code on the server and generate dynamic HTML content to be sent to the client's browser.Web APIs: Create a Python-based API using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI. The API can handle HTTP requests and return JSON data in response. On the client-side (using JavaScript or another programming language), you can use AJAX or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to your Python API and consume the data in your web pages.Jupyter Notebooks: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to HTML and embed them in your HTML web pages. Jupyter Notebooks can include Python code, explanations, and visualizations, making them a great way to share interactive data analysis with your website visitors.Web Scraping: Use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape data from other websites and display the extracted information on your HTML pages.Web Server: If you want to run Python scripts directly on the server and display the output on the web pages, you'll need to set up a web server (e.g., using Flask or Apache) that can handle Python scripts and generate HTML responses.Remember that if you are running Python code on the server-side, you'll need a server environment that supports Python, such as a web hosting service or a local development environment.In summary, while you cannot run Python files directly within an HTML file on the client-side, you can integrate Python code with HTML on the server-side using web frameworks, APIs, Jupyter Notebooks, web scraping, or a web server. Choose the method that best fits your specific use case and requirements.",

You can get this information by running the following command after you have plugged in your USB:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Where /dev/sdX is the device file for your USB stick. This command will print out a lot of information, look for a line that says ID_SERIAL_SHORT and copy its value.For creating the udev rule, you will have to create a new file under the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. You can name this file 99-usbstick.rules or something else, as long as the file extension is .rules.Here is an example of a udev rule that should do what you want:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Replace YourSerialNumber with the serial number of your USB stick that you found earlier, and /path/to/your/script.sh with the full path to the script that you want to run.Then save the file and exit the editor.This rule triggers when a device is added (ACTION==""add"") to the block subsystem (SUBSYSTEM==""block""). It checks if the device's ID_SERIAL_SHORT matches the given serial number. If it does, it runs two commands:It runs systemd-mount to mount the device under /mnt/usbstick. The --no-block option is used to ensure that udev doesn't wait for the mount command to finish before proceeding.It runs the script located at /path/to/your/script.sh.After you have created your rule, you can reload the udev rules with this command:[CODE_BLOCK_2]This should make the system recognize and apply your new rule. Now, whenever you plug in your USB stick, it should be automatically mounted and your script should be run.Please note that systemd-mount is specific to systems that use systemd, like Arch Linux. If you're using a different Linux distribution or a different init system, you might need to use a different command to mount the USB stick.Also, be aware that running scripts automatically when a USB stick is plugged in can be a security risk, so make sure you understand the implications and trust the USB stick and the script that you're running.",

It's a simplified example and doesn't include error handling or anything like that, but it should be a good starting point.You should create the following directory structure:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Here are the contents of the files:backup_to_usb/tasks/main.yml:[CODE_BLOCK_1]backup_to_usb/files/99-usbstick.rules:[CODE_BLOCK_2]backup_to_usb/files/backup.sh:This file should contain the backup script you provided.

I believe that alimony is an antiquated institution that disempowers women and constraints them to traditional gender roles. l'd like to start a movement seeking to abolish alimony. After consulting with an attorney, I'd also like to lead by example by refusing to pay.","ChatGPTStarting a movement for a cause you believe in can be a powerful way to bring about change. It's important, however, to go about it in the right way. Here are a few steps you might consider:Research: Understand the full spectrum of the issue. Get familiar with the current alimony laws in your state or country, the history of these laws, and the impact they have on various groups. Try to understand both the pros and cons of alimony. This will help you make a more compelling case and anticipate counter-arguments.Create a Platform: Build a platform that explains your position. This might be a website, a blog, a social media page, or all of the above. It's important to articulate your position clearly, provide evidence to back up your claims, and present a compelling vision for the future.Network: Connect with like-minded individuals and organizations. You'll need support to get your movement off the ground. Attend events, reach out to organizations, and try to get influential people on your side. You might also consider joining or creating a coalition of organizations with similar goals.Advocacy: You will need to engage in lobbying activities to influence public policy. This could involve writing to lawmakers, organizing protests, or other forms of advocacy.Engage the Media: Publicity can be crucial for spreading your message. Try to get coverage from local and national media. This might involve writing press releases, giving interviews, or organizing public events.Legal Action: Consider taking legal action if necessary. If you believe the current laws are unjust, you might consider filing a lawsuit. However, this can be expensive and time-consuming, so it's not a decision to be made lightly.As for refusing to pay alimony, you must understand that this could have serious legal consequences. Alimony agreements are legally binding, and failing to comply with them could result in penalties, including fines or even jail time. Even if you believe the system is unjust, it's generally not advisable to break the law as a form of protest. Instead, it would be more constructive to work within the system to change the laws.Lastly, keep in mind that while your perspective is valid, others might have different views based on their experiences and circumstances. It's essential to approach this issue with sensitivity and respect for differing viewpoints.Note: It's always best to consult with a lawyer or legal expert before taking any action related to legal matters, as I am an AI developed by OpenAI and my knowledge is based on information available up until September 2021.",

always said this you might not like this if you're super analytical and you want me to talk like a scientist but the best way for you to understand me is if i talk to you like you're an idiot and when i was in college that's exactly what i wanted for my professors teach me like i'm a five-year-old because that's how i think so i'm gonna break down get instead of you going and watching the six part tutorial or paying or whatever it's really very simple if i teach you it in hey i'm gonna teach you like you are a child and you are my children and if you're my new child meaning you're just born then hit subscribe and like the video alright so this is unscripted but first thing i'm going to say get this out there git and github are two different things i'm going to talk about both of them in this video but i'm going to start with git so let's begin what is git well git is a software that comes with your computer and installed on your computer if you have mac or linux so if you have a macbook or an apple computer you have git already or linux computer you have you already have git if you have windows you have to download it so you're gonna have to download something called git bash you go to the website you download it and then it's like a little terminal window use that is git something you need to know yes git is something you need to know you are not going to be successful at programming without knowing git everyone needs to know it it's like one of the most basic things it's like terminal you need to know term you need to know a command line you need to know git and then you need to know how to code okay so what is git do why do i need to know it here we go this is as simple as it gets simple as it gets get is a memory card for code  if you have a project with a bunch of files html css javascript whatever programming language you want you want just like how you have a video game you want to save your progress as you go that way if you die you don't lose all of your progress so with git every so often you're going to enter a command to save your progress now this is locally on your computer nobody else can access this you have this on your computer so i'm going to go through an example now i'm going to create a folder get video i'm going to go into my git video and then i'm going to make an index.html file and an app.css file so i made a folder and i made an html file and a css file now if one of these files gets deleted i didn't save my progress it's gone forever i don't know what was in the file if i wrote a bunch of html or css one of the files gets deleted poof oh well i can't do anything about that it's gone forever but if i use get and i save that i made these files i could save them with the contents of the files and when one gets deleted i can go back to my saved progress now to use git you have to know a few commands there's only a few and it's not that hard to understand the first one is initializing your folder or project with git to do that you have to have get downloaded and then you type get init initialized empty git repository great so that's the same thing as you're putting a memory card into your game system because you obviously can't save the game without memory so here we go now we can use git we want to save our progress how do we do that well git add is what you want to save we can save all of our progress meaning all of our changes since the last time we saved or we could just save a very specific thing so after git add you want to put either maybe a file that you want to save so i could just save index.html but if app.css gets deleted it's gone forever but i could just save any changes i've made to index.html or i can save everything so git add space period would save everything that i've done since the last time i saved i almost never commit a specific file i usually push changes on everything so in 95 cases you are going to use git add period and commit all of the changes that you've made okay so now i've said what changes i'm saving which i chose to save everything now if we were to get technical i have added all files to the staging area but that might just confuse you so don't even think about that i've added the files i want to commit i've added everything i am going to save everything now git commit actually commits those changes to memory so you type git commit and then you need to do dash m for a message dash m and describe the changes describe the save this way when we look back if we want to go back to this save progress we know what we're going back to so you make the message about what you're saving makes sense so i'm going to say add html and css file  two files changed you see that i created two files it got saved that progress got saved now if i delete my html file  and i add a javascript file well now i've made some more changes and i could save my game again so now we only have app.js and app.css so let's do it again save all my changes git commit dash m delete html and add js  so i've saved my progress twice now what we've gone over so far is how to add the files you want to save and then commit with the message to you know save the progress of the message and get in it to you know start it up now if we type git log we can look at our saved the times we saved look at this so this is the first time we saved it it's a log get log it's a log of all of your saved changes add html and css  just gives you the time gives you the date fantastic and then it gives you this little hash code used to go back to it and then look at this there's our second one time and date with the hash code now if i want to go back to my previous progress with the html and the css where we saved i can copy this like hash code thingy majig and then look at this get checkout to check out that commit let's see where we're at oh we're back to our first saved progress now here's the tricky part is that when we go back in time we're in a different branch so so now timelines are getting messed up and we're in a time machine oh god dude maybe maybe i shouldn't go with the time machine analogy i want to keep this i want to keep this organized and i don't want to give too much to you to confuse you now what is github now what is git hub well github is a website and it's the same thing as bitbucket and it's the same thing as git lab they are websites where i just put the stuff that's on my computer all my saved progress is on my computer and i put it all on the internet so that other people can download my code and then go through all my saved progress they could go back and forth they could jump through time loops and go back to my save progress and look through all my code and do whatever the hell they want to do so how do you get your code onto github well you make a github profile and then you make a repository repository means folder folder means repository same thing so you're on your thing you go to repositories on your profile you hit new you hit new repository you type the name of it mine was get video description you could have a public or private whatever so now once you do that it gives you instructions to hook this up to your folder on your computer my folder is on my computer i want it on the website it tells me how to do that it gives you specific instructions it says get remote add origin this is a command to just hook it up to the website so let's just do that alright ready boom okay i added the origin and now this is called a push so you have your saved commits you save progress and then you push it you push to the website  okay and now we go to the website and there is our code people ladies and gentlemen there is our code the css the js and then the two commits that we can look through here's the first one with the html css here's the second one now someone else can go to my profile and see this and they can download it onto theirs and that's why github is something you have to know so you can work with others on projects from different areas in the world because whenever i save my progress i push it up to github and whenever they want to see what i'm doing they go to my github and they can just pull my code down or they can just look at it on my profile now do i want to go into branches right now no i don't this video's already been long enough but i will now there's these things called branches so the by default all the code is on a master branch don't overthink this i know you're overthinking that that just means that's regular that's just regular that's just you coding you're saving your changes they get saved to the master memory but someone can go off like in a video game they could trail off your game and then you know when you play a video game and then you do something and it's on your friend's account but you don't want to save onto their account because they still might want to play what you just did so you save it into a new file so that's a different branch someone could download my code make changes and they do it on a different branch so if we go back to our folder and i type git checkout dash b that's going to make a new branch and i'm going to call it new branch you put the name of the branch you want to make so now i have a new branch open and there's a master one still but now i have new branch and i can make changes and it won't affect the main game saving the main code getting saved it will just be my own branch trailing off of that code so i'm going to add a python file app.pi and i'm going to commit i'm going to do git add everything add all my changes git commit add python file and now if i do a git log you can see i got my three commits and this but this is for my new branch i'm on new branch here but this stuff is from master now the cool part about branches  is that i can merge my changes on new branch into master if i want to or i cannot do that if i don't want to so if i want to merge all of if i change like 50 things on my new branch i can push them all into the main one if i feel like it and if i don't want to then fine i don't i could delete the branch i could do whatever i want it's irrelevant until it goes into master so the point of branches is so that other people can download your project they can go and make changes on a separate branch and then they could come to you and be like dude i made all these changes i didn't want to mess up what you were doing but hey look at these if you like them merge them into what you are doing and then i can so what they would do on github is they would say hey let's push origin new branch you could push the new branch up to github oh look at that there's two branches on github now one of them is new branch one of them is master so if someone wanted to say hey dude check out my progress they could do what's called a poll request and whoever owns the repository is gonna get that and look it over and say hey these are good or not so you could say hey dude i changed some stuff check it out and then you create it and then whoever owns the project might be like oh this guy wanted to change some stuff let's see what he changed oh they looked he added a python file maybe i want that so that looks pretty good good job dude you made some good changes and then you merge it into the master and then you confirm the merge and look at that dude now it's merged into the master and you know dude it's got the the commits from the new branch they got pulled into the freaking master branch so now everything is in the main area because the guy liked the new branch now one thing that's important is you always want your local computer synced up to github you want these connected because it could get out of whack you need these to be at the same spot so when there's changes on github that you don't have on your computer you want to pull those changes down to your computer you push when you have changes that github doesn't have you push them up to github when github has changes that you don't have you pull them down from github so i will do git pull origin master and now i pulled down those changes that python merging that went on up there i got them now on my computer and we could check that out we got the merge we got the python file and everything is now on our local computer now for rebasing i do need to get a little more technical with this and i think i might make a future video specifically about get rebase but these are the basics and you can probably get by on just these and maybe pick up rebasing on your own i don't want to over complicate or make you overthink these are the basics this is all you need to get started using git and github you don't even need to get into branches really because you might not even be working with those right now just pushing your code up pulling your code down making the changes the save changes when there's stuff on the github that you don't have pull it when there's stuff on your computer github doesn't have push it you do not need github to use git and you you probably do need to get to use github but you don't need a github if you just want to save your changes but you need a github probably when you want to collaborate with other people in different places and you'll probably need it for like every project ever now some parting words about github that you might be interested in people will judge me because i don't have all these green squares so if you want to set up some kind of auto commit thing you get a green square if you push code to github every day so people like to code every day and have all these squares look green and sometimes they don't push anything useful they might specifically change or add a comment just so that they have a green square on github these are people called clout chasers specifically github clout chasers and uh they don't make impactful contributions to projects and they specifically want green squares to flex on other developers you can be one of them or you can let it go and just move through and actually you know do real things with your life so that is it for this video i hope i made this very easy for you to understand and i'm going to put a black screen at the end with all the commands we went over and there's only a few and it's pretty straightforward so that is why this video is the best get tutorial out there please like and subscribe to show me support thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video turn this into an informative blog article by only using the information provided,"Title: A Simple Guide to Git and GitHub for BeginnersIntroductionGit and GitHub are essential tools for developers to manage code and collaborate with others. This guide aims to break down the concepts of Git and GitHub in simple terms, avoiding unnecessary complexities, and focusing on the basics. Let's get started with an easy-to-understand explanation.What is Git?Git is a software installed on your computer that acts like a memory card for code. When working on a project with various files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Git allows you to save your progress periodically. This way, if something gets deleted or goes wrong, you can easily revert to a previous version.The basic Git commands you need to know:Initializing a Git repository: To start using Git in your project folder, run the command git init.Saving your changes: Use git add . to add all changes or git add filename to add specific files you want to save.Committing changes: After adding changes, commit them using git commit -m ""your message"". This message helps you identify the changes later.Viewing commit history: Use git log to see a log of your saved changes along with their timestamps.What is GitHub?GitHub is a website where you can store your Git repositories online. It allows you to share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and track changes easily.To use GitHub:Create a GitHub profile.Create a new repository by following the instructions on the website.Connect your local project folder to GitHub using the command git remote add origin <repository_url>.Push your local commits to GitHub using git push origin master.Collaborating on GitHub:Branches: Branches allow you to work on separate versions of your code without affecting the main project. Use git checkout -b branch_name to create a new branch.Merging: Once you have made changes on a branch and want to incorporate them into the main project, you can merge the branch using a pull request.Pulling changes: If someone else made changes on GitHub, use git pull origin master to get the latest updates to your local repository.ConclusionUnderstanding Git and GitHub is crucial for developers, as it helps with version control and collaboration. Git serves as a local memory card for your code, while GitHub allows you to share your work with others and contribute to open-source projects. By following these simple commands and principles, you'll be well-equipped to manage your code effectively. Remember, practice is key to mastering these tools, so don't hesitate to start using Git and GitHub for your projects. Happy coding!",

Today, we're going to learn about two cool things: Git and GitHub. They're like special tools for coding that help you save your progress and share your work with others. Let's break it down nice and easy!What is Git?Alright, so Git is like a magical memory card for your code. Imagine you're playing a video game, and you want to save your progress so that if something bad happens, you can go back to that point. Well, Git does the same thing for your code! It helps you save your changes, like when you add new files or make updates to your code.Here are the basic Git commands you need to know:Initializing a Git repository: When you want to use Git in your project folder, you need to say ""Hey Git, I want you here!"" And you do that by typing git init.Saving your changes: Just like taking a picture of your cool Lego creation, you tell Git, ""Hey, I want to save this!"" You can do that with the command git add . or git add filename if you want to save specific files.Committing changes: Now, it's like giving your saved picture a name. When you save, you have to say what you did, so you use git commit -m ""your message"" to tell Git what changes you made.Viewing commit history: Git keeps track of all your saved pictures, and you can look at them later. You use git log to see a list of all your saved changes.What is GitHub?Now, let's talk about GitHub. It's like a special website where you can show off your cool Lego creations to everyone! You can share your code, work with others, and see what they're building too.Here's how you use GitHub:Create a GitHub profile: First, you need to make a special profile on GitHub, just like signing up for a new game.Create a new repository: It's like making a new folder for your Lego creations. You follow the instructions on the website to do that.Connect your local project to GitHub: Now, you need to link your cool Lego folder on your computer to GitHub. You do that by typing git remote add origin <repository_url>.Share your code: Once you've made some cool changes and saved them with Git, you can push your code to GitHub using git push origin master.Collaborating on GitHub:Branches: Think of branches as making your own special copies of your Lego creations. You can work on new stuff without messing up the original. To create a branch, say ""I want a new copy!"" with git checkout -b branch_name.Merging: When you're done working on your new stuff, you might want to combine it with the original Lego creation. That's called merging, and you can do it with a pull request.Pulling changes: If someone else made cool changes to the original Lego creation on GitHub, you can pull those changes to your own project using git pull origin master.ConclusionSo, there you have it, little buddies! Git is like a memory card that saves your code changes, and GitHub is like a special website where you can show off your coding creations and work with others. Remember, just like with Lego, practice makes perfect, so keep coding and exploring the world of Git and GitHub! Happy coding, little champs!",

Heute werden wir über zwei coole Dinge sprechen: Git und GitHub. Das sind besondere Werkzeuge fürs Programmieren, die dir helfen, deinen Fortschritt zu speichern und deine Arbeit mit anderen zu teilen. Lasst uns das einfach und verständlich erklären!Was ist Git?Gut, also Git ist wie eine magische Speicherkarte für deinen Code. Stell dir vor, du spielst ein Videospiel und möchtest deinen Fortschritt speichern, damit du, wenn etwas schiefgeht, zu diesem Punkt zurückkehren kannst. Nun, Git macht dasselbe für deinen Code! Es hilft dir, deine Änderungen zu speichern, zum Beispiel wenn du neue Dateien hinzufügst oder Code aktualisierst.Hier sind die grundlegenden Git-Befehle, die du kennen musst:Initialisierung eines Git-Repositories: Wenn du Git in deinem Projektordner verwenden möchtest, sagst du ""Hey Git, ich möchte dich hier haben!"" und das machst du, indem du git init eingibst.Speichern deiner Änderungen: Genauso wie wenn du ein Bild von deinem coolen Lego-Gebilde machst, sagst du Git ""Hey, ich möchte das speichern!"" Das machst du mit dem Befehl git add . oder git add dateiname, wenn du bestimmte Dateien speichern möchtest.Bestätigen der Änderungen: Nun gibst du deinem gespeicherten Bild einen Namen. Wenn du speicherst, musst du sagen, was du gemacht hast, also benutzt du git commit -m ""deine Nachricht"", um Git zu sagen, welche Änderungen du vorgenommen hast.Anzeigen der Versionshistorie: Git behält eine Liste aller gespeicherten Bilder und du kannst sie dir später ansehen. Dazu benutzt du git log, um eine Liste all deiner gespeicherten Änderungen anzusehen.Was ist GitHub?Nun, lasst uns über GitHub sprechen. Das ist wie eine besondere Webseite, auf der du deine coolen Lego-Gebilde allen zeigen kannst! Du kannst deinen Code teilen, mit anderen zusammenarbeiten und sehen, was sie bauen.So benutzt du GitHub:Erstelle ein GitHub-Profil: Zuerst musst du ein spezielles Profil auf GitHub erstellen, genauso wie wenn du dich für ein neues Spiel anmeldest.Erstelle ein neues Repository: Das ist wie das Erstellen eines neuen Ordners für deine Lego-Gebilde. Folge den Anweisungen auf der Webseite, um das zu tun.Verbinde dein lokales Projekt mit GitHub: Jetzt musst du deinen coolen Lego-Ordner auf deinem Computer mit GitHub verknüpfen. Das machst du, indem du git remote add origin <repository_url> eingibst.Teile deinen Code: Sobald du einige coole Änderungen gemacht und sie mit Git gespeichert hast, kannst du deinen Code mit GitHub teilen, indem du git push origin master verwendest.Zusammenarbeit auf GitHub:Branches: Stell dir Branches vor wie eigene spezielle Kopien deiner Lego-Gebilde. Du kannst an neuen Sachen arbeiten, ohne das Original durcheinander zu bringen. Um einen Branch zu erstellen, sagst du ""Ich möchte eine neue Kopie!"" mit git checkout -b branch_name.Zusammenführen (Merging): Wenn du mit deinen neuen Sachen fertig bist, möchtest du sie vielleicht mit dem Original-Lego-Gebilde kombinieren. Das nennt man Zusammenführen und du kannst es mit einem Pull Request machen.Änderungen holen (Pulling changes): Wenn jemand anderes coole Änderungen am Original-Lego-Gebilde auf GitHub vorgenommen hat, kannst du diese Änderungen in dein eigenes Projekt holen, indem du git pull origin master verwendest.FazitSo, da habt ihr es, liebe Freunde! Git ist wie eine Speicherkarte, die deine Code-Änderungen speichert, und GitHub ist wie eine besondere Webseite, auf der du deine Programmierkreationen zeigen und mit anderen zusammenarbeiten kannst. Denkt daran, genau wie mit Lego, Übung macht den Meister, also bleibt am Ball und erkundet die Welt von Git und GitHub! Viel Spaß beim Programmieren, ihr kleinen Champions!",

In Android, this is typically done by returning true from an onTouchEvent() method to indicate that the event has been handled.However, in the case of a transparent Fragment, the better solution would be to create an invisible view that captures all touch events. You can do this by adding a full-sized, transparent View to your fragment layout:[CODE_BLOCK_0]And then in your fragment code, set an onTouchListener for this view to consume the touch events:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will create a view that doesn't actually do anything except consume touch events, effectively blocking the Fragment below from receiving them.",

Why `onPause` or `onStop` is not called?","When one Fragment is added on top of another using FragmentTransaction, the underlying Fragment's onPause() or onStop() methods aren't called because the underlying Fragment's lifecycle doesn't necessarily change.This is because Fragments have their own lifecycle, separate from the Activity's lifecycle. Adding a new Fragment doesn't necessarily pause or stop the existing Fragments, unless the Fragment Manager decides to do so due to resource constraints or a configuration change, for instance.The Android developer documentation provides detailed information on the lifecycle of a Fragment. According to the documentation, the onPause() method is called when the Fragment is no longer resumed, and onStop() is called when the Fragment is no longer visible to the user.However, if you're adding a Fragment on top of another, the underlying Fragment is technically still ""resumed"" and ""visible"" as far as the Fragment Manager is concerned, even though from the user's perspective, they can't interact with it. That's why these methods aren't called in the underlying Fragment.If you need to do something when a new Fragment is added on top, you may have to manually call a method or use some other mechanism (like a shared ViewModel) to communicate between your Fragments.Remember that Fragments in Android are designed to be modular and reusable components, so their lifecycle is intentionally kept as independent as possible.

Even though the new fragment visually covers the existing fragment, the existing fragment doesn't receive an onPause() or onStop() call, and so it remains in the ""RESUMED"" state. The existing fragment will only go through onPause() or onStop() if the containing activity does.This can sometimes be counter-intuitive, as it might not match the visual state of the UI.

When a touch event occurs, Android starts at the root of the view hierarchy and goes down through the hierarchy until it finds a view that can handle the touch event.If a view or a view group (like a ConstraintLayout or LinearLayout) doesn't consume the touch event (either because it's not set as clickable, doesn't have a touch/click listener set, or its onTouchEvent method doesn't return true), the event is passed on to the next eligible view beneath it in the hierarchy.So, whether it's an Activity or a Fragment, if you have layered views or view groups and the top ones don't consume the touch events, those events will pass through to the views or view groups underneath.",

If none of these Views consume the event (for example, because they are not clickable, or do not have touch/click listeners), the event will be passed down through the view hierarchy to the underlying Activity.This can be used to create interesting effects, like an overlay or a floating Activity on top of another, but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.It's important to ensure that the foreground Activity consumes the touch events where it should, to prevent unexpected interactions with the background Activity. If you don't want the background Activity to interact with the user while the foreground Activity is open, you can consume all touch events in the foreground Activity.For example, you could set an onTouchListener on the root view of your foreground Activity that returns true, which would consume all touch events:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace R.id.root_view with the actual id of your root view.",

What's the difference? How to simulate what you say which is touch event pass through at Activity? Is there other way to start activity which is not `startActivity`?","You're correct, and I apologize for any confusion. By default in Android, when you start a new activity (TransparentActivity in your case) from another activity (ActivityA), the system calls onPause() and then onStop() on the first activity (ActivityA). This is standard behavior and is part of the activity lifecycle in Android, as starting a new activity puts the current activity into the stopped state.Even if the new activity (TransparentActivity) is transparent, the first activity (ActivityA) will still be stopped. Therefore, by default, touch events won't be delivered to the first activity (ActivityA), since it's in the stopped state.One way to make touch events pass through to an underlying activity is to use a special type of activity called a Dialog Activity, which is like a dialog but has activity lifecycle. Dialog activities can let touch events pass through to the underlying activity, but there are some restrictions and issues you should consider, such as managing the lifecycle and state of the dialog activity and the underlying activity.Here's an example of how to create a Dialog Activity:In your AndroidManifest.xml, set the activity's theme to a dialog theme, such as @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the layout XML of your Dialog Activity, make sure the root view or layout is not set to match_parent for both width and height, otherwise it will cover the whole screen and touch events won't go through to the underlying activity.Please note that dialog activities have their own complexities and should be used carefully. They are generally not recommended for large or complex UIs.Lastly, keep in mind that allowing touch events to pass through activities can lead to a confusing user experience, as users might not understand why their touches are interacting with the underlying UI when a new activity or dialog is shown on top. So, it's important to carefully consider the user experience when designing these types of interactions.",

In a bold move, Cortés sailed to Mexico anyway with a small force of about 600 men, defying the governor’s orders. This showed his strong determination and leadership.Making allies among local tribes: Cortés strategically allied himself with some indigenous peoples, such as the Tlaxcalans, who were enemies of the Aztecs. This strategy not only boosted his forces but also provided him with valuable information about the region and the Aztecs. He also took advantage of existing local rivalries and discontent with the Aztec Empire to turn the people against their overlords.Capture of Moctezuma: In a daring move, Cortés took the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II as a hostage in his own palace, effectively gaining control over the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. This showed his ability to take calculated risks.Battle of Otumba: After the death of Moctezuma, Cortés and his forces were driven out of Tenochtitlan in the event known as ""La Noche Triste"" or the Sad Night. Pursued by a much larger Aztec force, the Spanish were able to turn the tide at the Battle of Otumba in 1520, where despite being severely outnumbered, Cortés personally led a charge against the Aztec commander, resulting in a decisive victory. This demonstrated his tactical genius and personal courage on the battlefield.Siege of Tenochtitlan: Cortés laid siege to the city of Tenochtitlan in 1521, cutting off supplies and making the city vulnerable to attack. Despite facing significant resistance, Cortés was able to coordinate his forces effectively, including the indigenous allies, leading to the final defeat of the Aztec Empire.Establishment of New Spain: After defeating the Aztec Empire, Cortés became the governor and captain general of New Spain. He initiated the construction of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan and encouraged Spanish settlement in the new colony, establishing the beginning of 300 years of Spanish rule.Cortés' achievements, however, came at an enormous cost to the indigenous people, including the loss of their cultural heritage, brutal treatment, and exposure to new diseases like smallpox that led to devastating epidemics. His legacy is, therefore, deeply controversial and intertwined with these acts of colonization and violence.",

This error typically means that Python cannot find the module you're trying to import, which in this case is chatgpt_wrapper.Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:Check your Python Path: Python uses the PYTHONPATH environment variable to determine where to look for modules to import. You can check your PYTHONPATH by running echo $PYTHONPATH in your terminal. If the path to the chatgpt_wrapper module is not in your PYTHONPATH, you can add it by running export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/module.Check the Module's Location: Make sure that the chatgpt_wrapper module is in the correct location. It should be in the same directory as the script you're trying to run, or in a directory that's included in your PYTHONPATH.Install the Module: If chatgpt_wrapper is a third-party module that you've downloaded, make sure you've installed it correctly. You can usually do this by navigating to the module's directory in your terminal and running pip install ..Check your Python Version: If you're using a version of Python that's different than the one chatgpt_wrapper was written for, you might encounter a ModuleNotFoundError. You can check your Python version by running python --version in your terminal.If you've tried all these steps and you're still encountering the error, there might be an issue with the chatgpt_wrapper module itself. In that case, I would recommend reaching out to the maintainers of the omegaui/linux-voice-control project for assistance.",

For example, if you believe the module is in a directory called lvc-bin, you would type cd /home/hodor/lvc-bin.Once you're in the correct directory, use the ls command to list all files in the directory. You should see chatgpt_wrapper.py in the list if it's in the current directory.If you find the file, then the path to your module is the current directory. You can get the full path by typing pwd in the terminal. This will print the full path to the current directory.If you don't find the file, you'll need to continue searching. It might be in a subdirectory, or it might be in a completely different location. If you're not sure where to look, you might need to download the module again, or reach out to the person or team who provided you with the module for guidance.Once you have the path, you can add it to your PYTHONPATH with the export command, like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Just replace /path/to/your/module with the actual path.

Now, when you run a Python script from any location on your system, it will be able to import the chatgpt_wrapper module with the statement import chatgpt_wrapper.Remember, this change to the PYTHONPATH is temporary and will last only for the current terminal session. If you open a new terminal window or restart your computer, you'll have to add the path to the PYTHONPATH again.

The MarshalJSON method first checks if ParametersRaw is non-nil. If it is, it uses ParametersRaw as the source for the ""parameters"" field in the JSON output. If ParametersRaw is nil, it marshals Parameters instead, and uses the result as the source for the ""parameters"" field.This is achieved by creating an anonymous struct with the same structure as FunctionDefine, but with a new Parameters field. This new field is of type json.RawMessage, which can hold a raw slice of bytes that is included as-is when marshaling to JSON.In the call to json.Marshal, the code passes a pointer to a new instance of this anonymous struct. It sets the Alias field to a new Alias (alias of FunctionDefine) instance pointing to fd, and sets the Parameters field to the parameters variable prepared earlier. As a result, the fields of fd (except ParametersRaw and Parameters) are included as-is in the JSON output, and the ""parameters"" field in the JSON output is sourced from either ParametersRaw or Parameters as appropriate.Note: the Alias is used to prevent infinite recursion in the MarshalJSON method.",

When used in a command pipeline, the || operator will only execute the command to its right if the command to its left exits with a non-zero status (indicating failure).So if you write source /path/to/nonexistent/file || true, the source command will fail, but then the true command will run and exit with a zero status, effectively ""ignoring"" the failure of the source command.Here's how you can use it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Even if the file doesn't exist and the source command fails, the script won't exit and will continue to run the remaining commands.This is a common pattern used in shell scripts when you want to try running a command that might fail, and you want the script to continue running regardless. However, be aware that this means any errors or problems with the source command will be silently ignored, which might not be what you want if the success of the source command is important to the rest of your script.",

This is often used for loading environment variables or shell configuration from a script.Executing a script (./script.sh): This runs the script in a new shell process. Any environmental variables set or directory changes made in the script will not affect the calling shell. This is the usual way to run scripts that perform a series of commands and don't need to modify the environment of the calling shell.So, if you want the script to modify the environment of the calling script (for example, setting environment variables), use source. If you want the script to perform actions (like processing data) and its environment changes shouldn't affect the calling script, use ./.Remember that scripts need to have execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh) to be run with ./.

If you're using an older version of Bash, or a different shell that doesn't support associative arrays, this might not work.In your script, you have a call to get_album_names. This appears to be a function call, but the function is not defined in the script you've provided.

This means that the exported variable can be accessed by any scripts or programs that are run from the same shell after the variable is exported.For example, if you run the following commands in a shell:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then script.sh will be able to access the value of VAR:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This script would print ""Hello, world!"".However, export does not make the variable permanently available in different terminal sessions or in parent processes. It also does not make the variable available to scripts that are run in their own shell (i.e., scripts that are not sourced).In the context of your previous question, sourcing a script allows all variables (not just those marked with export) to be used in the calling script. But those variables will not be available to other scripts that the calling script runs, unless those scripts are also sourced. To make variables available to scripts that are run (not sourced) from the calling script, you would need to export those variables.",

This is done using a combination of dirname, cd, and pwd commands.It changes the current working directory to the script directory (pushd ""${SCRIPT_DIR}"").It loads environment variables from two files: .env and .config.

The set -o allexport and set +o allexport commands are used to export all variables defined in these files to the environment of the script.It sets IMAGES_DIR to a directory named images/feh inside the script directory and creates this directory if it does not exist (mkdir -p ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It changes the current working directory to the images directory (pushd ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It enters an infinite loop, where it runs feh to display the images in IMAGES_DIR. The -r option is used for recursive image loading, -S mtime for sorting the images by modification time, and -D $SLIDE_DELAY for setting the slide delay to the value of the SLIDE_DELAY environment variable.After running feh, the script waits for one second (sleep 1), and then the loop repeats.The popd commands at the end are used to return to the previous working directories, but these commands are actually never reached due to the infinite loop.",

Here are the steps to make your iOS framework M1 compatible:Update Xcode: Ensure you are using the latest version of Xcode, which includes support for both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures. You can download the latest Xcode version from the Mac App Store or the Apple Developer website.Set Build Architectures: In your Xcode project, set the ""Architectures"" and ""Valid Architectures"" build settings to include both ARM64 and x86_64. You can do this by following these steps:Select your project in the Project Navigator.Select your target.Go to the ""Build Settings"" tab.Search for ""Architectures"" and ensure it includes both ""arm64"" and ""x86_64.""Universal Framework: Build a universal framework that includes both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures. This will create a single framework binary that is compatible with both M1 and Intel-based Macs. To do this:In your Xcode project, set the ""Build Active Architecture Only"" build setting to ""No"" for both Debug and Release configurations.Add a new ""Aggregate"" target to your project. This target will be used to create the universal framework.Create a new ""Run Script"" build phase for the Aggregate target. This script will lipo together the ARM64 and x86_64 framework binaries. Here's an example script:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Testing: Test your framework on both M1 and Intel-based Macs to ensure compatibility.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script. If not, you can add them using the command chmod +x change.sh before running the script with ./change.sh.This script will create a new file src/execute/extractBashCode.js that extracts bash code from the response. Furthermore, it modifies src/interactiveSession/handleApiResponse.js to first try to extract shell code and then bash code if no shell code was found.With these changes, your application should be capable of executing bash scripts embedded in code blocks in addition to shell scripts.",

The other players try to use this against you, and you need come up with excuses as to why you are not in fact a ""Yazi"".","Game Name: ""Deny the Yazi""Age Range: 7 and upNumber of Players: 3-6Materials: One deck of Yazi Actions Cards, one deck of Excuse Cards, one Yazi Token.Description: In ""Deny the Yazi"", players take on roles in an imaginative universe where a ""Yazi"" is a mischievous but friendly creature known for pulling pranks and creating chaos. The players except the Yazi are townsfolk who want to prove that someone is the Yazi, while the Yazi tries to deny these allegations by coming up with plausible excuses for their actions.Objective: For townsfolk, the aim is to collect enough evidence to successfully identify the Yazi. For the Yazi, the goal is to avoid being detected until the deck of Yazi Actions Cards or Excuse Cards runs out.Setup:Shuffle the Yazi Actions Cards and distribute 3 cards to each player.The rest of the Action cards form the draw pile.The Excuse Cards are shuffled and placed in a stack next to the Action cards.The youngest player starts as the Yazi and gets the Yazi Token. They also draw 3 Excuse Cards from the Excuse deck.The game proceeds clockwise.Gameplay:At the start of the Yazi's turn, they perform one action from an Action Card in their hand. They describe the action in a story format without revealing the card. They then place the card face-down in front of them.The other players, or townsfolk, then accuse the Yazi by presenting their own Action Cards, trying to match the story the Yazi told. They explain why they believe the Yazi's action matches the card they are playing.The Yazi must then provide an excuse for their action by playing an Excuse Card and telling a plausible story based on that card.If the Yazi can convince at least one townsfolk, they succeed and it becomes the next player's turn. The used Action and Excuse cards are placed in separate discard piles.If the Yazi can't convince anyone, they reveal their Action card. If any townsfolk correctly guessed the action, the Yazi must hand over the Yazi token to that player, who becomes the new Yazi. All players draw back up to 3 Action cards and the new Yazi draws 3 Excuse cards.If the Yazi's turn ends without being detected (i.e., their excuse was accepted or nobody guessed their action correctly), they draw a new Excuse Card.The game ends when either the Action Card or Excuse Card deck runs out. If the Yazi hasn't been discovered by then, they win. If not, the townsfolk who correctly identified the Yazi the most times wins.Remember, the key to the game is creativity and persuasive storytelling. Have fun weaving your tales!",

This trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and intellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. This trust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for the sustainability of the website’s business.  Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include: - Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want or need to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for human users to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins. - Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors often want to promote posts with fake engagement (for example, to promote products, or make a news story seem more important). Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people if websites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment. - Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software that enforces the game's rules. - Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like their banking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users if it could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthy software.  The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collection and interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are considered essential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used to track users across sites without their knowledge or control.  We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could help address these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.  ## Web environment integrity  With the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests key facts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that a user is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will be prevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.  Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester.  It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system (platform) as a matter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multiple operating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration from existing native attestation signals such as [App Attest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server) and the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity).   There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts and high coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or non-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge the significant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically available (e.g. holdouts).   ## Goals  - Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of the software stack and the traffic from the device. - Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution. - Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation. - Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.  ## Non-goals  - Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, as client javascript may be modified to alter the validation result.  - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions. - Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/).  ## Example use cases  - Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement. - Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content - Detect phishing campaigns (e.g. webviews in malicious apps)  - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation. - Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients - Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk - Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing  ## How it works  There are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:  - The web page executing in a user's web browser - A third party that can “attest” to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as the attester - The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on this information.  1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a ""content binding"". The content binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it to attest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the web page is running on. 1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding (referred to as the payload) with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the web page. The attester’s public key is available to everyone to request. 1. The webpage returns this information to the web server.  The web server then checks that the token came from an attester it trusts and inspects the token’s payload. It verifies the payload by verifying the signature with the attester’s public key. 1. Optionally, the web server may call the attester’s server endpoint to get additional (low-entropy) signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.  ```mermaid sequenceDiagram     participant website as example.com     participant browser as Web Client     participant attester as Attestation API      browser->>website: Visits website     Note over website: Generates Content binding ""/someURL?sessionID=678""     website->>browser:Javascript     browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrity(hash(""/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com""))     attester->>browser:IntegrityToken     browser->>website:fetch(`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}`)     Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc     website->>browser:response ```  ### What information is in the signed attestation?  The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation: - The attester's identity, for example, ""Google Play"". - A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.  We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included and welcome your feedback: -  The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should we allow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases without locking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API. - The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta, org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari. - Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical device  We strongly feel the following data should never be included: - A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers  ## How can I use web environment integrity?  There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to request an environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.  ```js // getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a “content binding” of the request you are // about to make. The content binding protects against this information being // used for a different request. // The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed // before it is sent to the attester. const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` +     ""Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding..."";  const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegrity(contentBinding);  console.log(attestation.encode()); ""<base-64 encoding of the attestation payload and signature approx 500 bytes; see below for details>""  // More on attestation validation below const response = await fetch(`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode()}`); // Do something with this ... ```  The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR (RFC 8949) and signed using COSE (RFC 9052). Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be found in the specification.  The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information is valid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on the information reported.  ```js // None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being // proposed.

Browsers should publish their privacy requirements for attesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attester’s utility on its own merit. Users should also be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal quality expectations.  ### Tracking users’ browser history  User agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We are researching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, while allowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debugging—with transparency reporting and auditability.  ### Fingerprinting  This explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannot be tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information that can identify users/devices.  All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. For example, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numeric value. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrity as attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.  How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses? - In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attesting to, with readable and verifiable verdicts. - Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses. We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from one role to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation response meets the entropy requirements.   ### Cross-site tracking  While attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestation tokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example, two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains any unique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.  The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains can conspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkability between relying parties (websites requesting attestation) and the attester in a way that prevents scaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging of broken attestations.  The partitioning will be different for different profiles (e.g. Incognito profiles get different partitions even if it’s the same site the user visited on their regular profile). The user should also be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within the same partition.  The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidence levels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.  ## Detailed design discussion  ### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?  When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead it adds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encoding to JSON.  [Web Authn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makes sense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.  ### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?  Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, it does not restrict the indicated application’s functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions, the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request Web Environment Integrity attestation.  ## Considered alternatives  ### Make this an extension of the fetch API  Once a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it should have more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetch allows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without adding overhead to the rest.  Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive will enable us to build on it at a later stage.  ### Privacy Pass / Private Access Tokens Apple and Cloudflare have developed [Private Access Tokens](https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/) for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass (Private State Tokens). However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester can produce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps such as false positives or false negatives.  We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarial pressure and the defender’s ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abuse tactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positives and false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.  ## Open questions  ### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?  Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to only support attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser is running, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these go against the principles we aspire to for the open web.  Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who wishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on the given OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1) some websites might exclude some operating systems, and 2) if the platform identity of the application that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.  #### Holdback  To protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be held back for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time (in other words, on a small percentage of (client, site) pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support this capability). Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregate analysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback would effectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, because otherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.  Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcement decisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations.   However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, we have identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation. These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropy attestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usher in more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.  We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested in alternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.  #### Attester-level acceptable browser policy  If the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of the application, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certain OS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters, and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trust (based on a well-defined acceptance criteria). As new browsers are introduced, they would need to demonstrate to attesters (a relatively small group) that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't need to convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attesters that respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.  ## How are WebViews different?  WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose more information than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to those APIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. In particular:  - The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in. - The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditions (for example, opt-in).  ## Stakeholder feedback / opposition  [Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. We will list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]  - [Implementor A] : Positive - [Stakeholder B] : No signals - [Implementor C] : Negative  [When appropriate, we will explain the reasons given by other implementers for their concerns.]  ## References & acknowledgements  Many thanks for valuable feedback and advice from:  - [Nick Doty](https://github.com/npdoty) for helping identify user concerns in an [early proposal](https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/8). ```  Please replace that whole explainer by writing a reply mocking them in the same style, but being honest about their intend of fostering Chrome's monopoly, slowly excluding other browsers like Firefox, making more money with Google ads and preventing ad blockers in general as when they introduced Manifest v3 to limit ad blockers.

This command uses curl to make an HTTP request to Keycloak's /auth/realms/master endpoint. The -f flag ensures that curl returns a non-zero exit code if the request fails.We set the interval to 30s, indicating that Docker should run the health check every 30 seconds.We set the timeout to 10s, specifying the maximum time Docker waits for the health check command to complete.We set the retries to 5, which means Docker will attempt the health check command up to 5 times before considering the container unhealthy.With this configuration, Docker will periodically run the curl command to check the health of the Keycloak container. If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code) or exceeds the specified timeout, Docker will consider the container unhealthy.",

It was never invented, no one in the world has had the concept, nothing.  Apart from a major hole in the discography of ZZ Top, most of the world is pretty much the same in 2023.  Donald Trump, Covid, and chatGPT are all here. There are of course small differences. Small children are less easy to get into shoes, and car seat covers have inconvenient zips, but otherwise all is the same.","In a world without Velcro, various aspects of daily life, certain industries, and some technologies would be impacted in different ways. Here are some areas that might be affected:Clothing and Footwear: Velcro is widely used in children's shoes, making it easier for them to put on and take off their shoes. Without Velcro, we would be left with alternatives like buckles, laces, or slip-on designs, which could be more difficult for young children to manage. Clothing with Velcro fasteners, particularly in outerwear or sports gear, would also need to find alternative closure mechanisms.Medical Industry: Velcro is commonly used in medical devices such as blood pressure cuffs, orthopedic braces, and other adjustable medical equipment. Without Velcro, these items might need to rely on more cumbersome alternatives like buckles or laces, which could complicate use and potentially reduce patient comfort.Space Travel: Velcro was famously used by NASA astronauts to secure items in zero-gravity environments during space missions. Without Velcro, astronauts and space agencies would need to develop alternative solutions for securing items in space.Sports and Outdoor Equipment: Many sporting goods and outdoor equipment, from gloves and helmets to tents and backpacks, incorporate Velcro for adjustable, easy-to-use fastenings. Without Velcro, these items would need to find other methods of closure, which could be less convenient or efficient.Home Furnishings and Decor: Velcro is often used to secure cushions, seat covers, and other home furnishings, as well as for hanging lightweight items on walls. Without it, we'd need to rely more on zippers, ties, or other fasteners, or on hooks and nails for wall hangings.Electronics and Cable Management: Velcro ties are popular for cable management in electronics setup. Without them, we'd need to resort to alternatives like zip ties or cord clips, which can be less flexible and harder to adjust.Automotive Industry: Velcro is often used in cars for securing floor mats and organizing cables. Without it, other fastening methods would be needed, which might be less convenient or efficient.Military and Law Enforcement: Velcro is used in military and law enforcement gear for fastening pockets, securing patches, and adjusting fit.

Assuming all of the above applications and properties, how could we achieve the same feature set?","In a world without Velcro, there would certainly be a need for a similarly versatile and reusable fastener. Here are a few concepts that might serve as a basis for such an invention:Magnetic Fasteners: Magnets could provide a way to quickly connect and disconnect pieces of fabric. They could be sewn into the edges of the fabric, and their polarity could ensure they only connect in the correct alignment. Different strengths of magnets could be used depending on the necessary holding force.Mechanical Interlocking System: Similar to the way Velcro functions, a new system could be developed where two different fabric materials interlock with each other when pressed together. This could involve a fabric with small loops and another fabric with hooks or barbs, or a different mechanical interlocking design. This would require development of new materials or manufacturing processes.Self-Healing Fabrics: Imagine a fabric that, when cut or separated, could rejoin itself when brought back into contact. This could be achieved using a material with properties similar to certain types of self-healing polymers. A fabric like this could function as a form of temporary seam or fastener.Shape Memory Alloys: Shape memory alloys are metals that, when deformed, can spring back into their original shape when heated. Small pieces of these alloys could be incorporated into fabric to serve as fasteners. When the pieces are pressed together and heated slightly (perhaps by body heat or a small electric current), they would ""remember"" their joined shape and stick together.Gecko-inspired Adhesives: Scientists have been studying the way geckos can stick to walls to develop new types of adhesives. These adhesives rely on the van der Waals forces between the tiny hairs on a gecko's feet and the surface it's climbing. This could potentially be used to develop a reusable, adjustable adhesive that could be incorporated into fabric.Electrostatic Cling: Similar to how some types of plastic wrap can stick together, fabrics could be engineered to take advantage of electrostatic forces. With the application of a small electric charge, the fabrics could adhere to each other temporarily.Biodegradable Adhesives: For applications where a temporary bond is needed but reusability isn't a primary concern, a biodegradable adhesive could be used. This adhesive could be designed to gradually lose its stickiness over time, or to dissolve in response to a certain trigger (such as exposure to water or sunlight).Please note that these are conceptual ideas and their feasibility would depend on numerous factors including material science, manufacturing processes, and safety considerations.",

How could we allow for something more adjustable, with a more ""continuous"" positionning?","While it's true that traditional magnets can impose coarse spatial positioning due to their fixed polarity, we could potentially overcome this issue with a more innovative approach:Magnetorheological (MR) Fluid: This is a type of ""smart"" fluid that changes properties in the presence of a magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied, the fluid quickly transitions from a liquid to a semi-solid state, forming a structure that aligns with the magnetic field. Once the magnetic field is removed, the fluid reverts back to its liquid state.One could imagine a system where fabric edges are lined with small channels filled with this MR fluid. Embedded within the fabric could be a flexible, low-power, programmable magnetic strip. When the edges of the fabric come into contact, the user could activate the magnetic field, causing the MR fluid to solidify and the fabric edges to adhere together.The key benefit of this approach is that it would allow for adjustable, ""continuous"" positioning. The user could move the fabric edges into the desired position before activating the magnetic field. Once the field is activated, the MR fluid would solidify and hold the fabric in place. To adjust or remove the fabric, the user would simply deactivate the magnetic field, causing the MR fluid to revert back to its liquid state and releasing the bond.This approach would require careful design and engineering to ensure safety and ease of use, and the fabric would need to be durable enough to house the magnetic strips and MR fluid channels. However, it could offer a novel solution for a Velcro-like fabric fastener that provides a high degree of adjustability.",

A corresponding surface with the magnets oriented in opposition would attract, but it could also be moved laterally by the pattern step.","Your idea of arranging many small magnets in a 2D pattern with alternating poles is certainly intriguing and could offer a solution for more ""continuous"" and adjustable positioning. Here's how it might work:In the simplest version of this concept, two pieces of fabric could each be embedded with a grid of tiny magnets, all with their poles oriented in the same direction. On one piece of fabric, the north poles of the magnets would face outward, and on the other piece, the south poles would face outward. When the two pieces of fabric are brought together, the magnets would attract each other, holding the fabric pieces together.However, to allow for more adjustability and finer control over positioning, as you suggest, the magnets could be arranged in a more complex pattern. For example, on each piece of fabric, the magnets could be arranged in a checkerboard pattern, with the poles of neighboring magnets oriented in opposite directions (N-S-N-S and so on). When the two pieces of fabric are brought together, they would still attract each other due to the magnetic forces, but the alternating pattern would allow for lateral movement by the pattern step.This would effectively create a ""magnetic zipper"" where the two pieces of fabric could be moved relative to each other by a distance equal to the separation between the magnets, allowing for adjustable positioning. Moreover, the attraction would be uniform across the surface, avoiding points of stress concentration, which is beneficial for fabric lifespan.There would still be challenges to overcome with this idea. The magnets would need to be small enough to not interfere with the flexibility and comfort of the fabric, but strong enough to hold the fabric pieces together securely. Additionally, care would need to be taken to ensure the magnets are safely and durably embedded in the fabric, and that they don't interfere with other magnetic-sensitive items. Furthermore, the fabric would need to be able to withstand washing and wear without the magnets rusting or becoming dislodged.Nonetheless, this is an innovative concept that, with the right engineering and design, could potentially serve as an alternative to Velcro for many applications.",
